# Car_scraper
This Python script allows you to scrape car data from a car listing website based on your desired car make and model.

## How It Works

The script performs a search on the car listing website using the provided car make and model. 
It then retrieves the car listings from the search results and extracts relevant car details 
such as make, model, year, and price.


#WIP#
Problem with retrieving individual links from each car that matches the provided data.
